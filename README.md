# [WikiSight](https://wiki-pageviews.vercel.app/)

WikiSight is an app that graphs the daily viewcounts of Wikipedia articles.

Users can search for a keyword. The app returns a list of related wikipedia articles. Users can click on these articles to see a graph of the viewcount over the last 60 days. The expanded view of articles also shows a brief description if one was provided by the API.
